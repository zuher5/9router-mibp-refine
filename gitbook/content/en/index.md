**Use Claude, Codex, Gemini for FREE • Ultra-cheap alternatives from $0.20/1M tokens**

9Router is an AI model router that maximizes your subscription value and minimizes costs through intelligent routing and automatic fallback.

## What is 9Router?

9Router is a smart proxy that sits between your coding tools (Cursor, Cline, Claude Desktop) and AI providers. It automatically routes requests to the best available model based on quota, cost, and availability.

**Stop wasting money:**
- ❌ Subscription quota expires unused every month
- ❌ Rate limits stop you mid-coding
- ❌ Expensive APIs ($20-50/month per provider)
- ❌ Manual switching between providers

**Start maximizing value:**
- ✅ **Maximize Subscriptions** - Track and use every bit of Claude Code, Codex, Gemini quota
- ✅ **FREE Available** - Access iFlow, Qwen, Kiro models via CLI
- ✅ **Ultra-Cheap Backup** - GLM ($0.6/1M), MiniMax M2.1 ($0.20/1M)
- ✅ **Smart Fallback** - Subscription → Cheap → Free, automatic switching

## Key Features

### 🔄 Smart 3-Tier Fallback

```
Setup once, never stop coding:

Tier 1 (SUBSCRIPTION): Claude Code → Codex → Gemini
  ↓ quota exhausted
Tier 2 (CHEAP): GLM-4.7 → MiniMax M2.1 → Kimi
  ↓ budget limit
Tier 3 (FREE): iFlow → Qwen → Kiro

→ Automatic switching, zero downtime!
```

### 📊 Quota Tracking

- Real-time token consumption per provider
- Reset countdown (5-hour, daily, weekly, monthly)
- Cost estimation for paid tiers
- Monthly spending reports

### 🎯 Universal CLI Support

Works with any tool that supports custom OpenAI endpoints:

✅ **Cursor** • **Cline** • **Claude Desktop** • **Codex** • **RooCode** • **Continue** • **Any OpenAI-compatible tool**

### 💰 Cost Optimization

**Real example (100M tokens/month):**
```
60M via Gemini CLI: $0 (free tier)
30M via Claude Code: $0 (subscription you already have)
8M via GLM: $4.80
2M via MiniMax: $0.40
Total: $5.20/month vs $2000 on ChatGPT API!
